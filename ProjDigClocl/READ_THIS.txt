The File - Design1nmi(1).dsn is the design file that needs to be run on ISIS/Proteus. 
The code to be entered to the processor (By right clicking it) - you need to enter a BIN file.
You may obtain the bin file by -
1)Compile the file - BasicDisp1nmi2(1).asm in Emu and obtain the bin file
2)In the Emu folder - Emu8086 - MyBuild - The bin file for the above asm file is directly available

The code is partially implemented since the course IC discontinued evaluatives for the code
mid-development. The code succesfully displays time (not AM/PM) and updates most components of 
the time. 

The Design is accurate. Implementing this design + adding an 8284 to obtain CLK signals and 
RESET will give you complete marks for the ON PAPER DESIGN component unless the design question 
has been modified. 

The remainder of the code may be developed and modified in accordance to the subroutines already written.
